Hi chalman, this is a little guide for email sending in java :
- First, include their jar files into your classpath
- Copy the code , and the little problem you should resolve is about sender information :
    . Use your mail for the sender address
    . For the password, you can't use your regular password, you should create an app password first
        Here is some step for creating an app password :
            - in your gmail setting https://myaccount.google.com/ , there is a search bar on the top, tap "Validation en deux Ã©tape" after you follow instruction
            - after you activate the 2-step verification add an app password and gmail will generate it and you use this
- here the file should be placed on the main, the upper under the SystemCommerce project

GOOD LUCK !!
